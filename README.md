# Culex_Biting_miRNA

This workflow will identify differentially expressed miRNAs in two Culex mosquito groups, non-biting *Culex pipiens molestus* and biting *Culex pipiens pipiens* lines, to help elucidate miRNAs associated with obligate non-biting.

Notes about the workflow for sequence analysis can be found in [MasterNotes.md](https://github.com/srmarzec/Culex_Biting_miRNA/blob/main/MasterNotes.md)
